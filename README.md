# Latent-Senmatic-Analysis-NLP

Here is my master thesis at New York University on Text Classification using Latent Semantic Analysis with Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Prof. Jonathan Goodman. I conducted research with Prof. Jonathan Goodman on the performance of social media text analytics using latent semantic analysis (LSA) with PCA and Sparse PCA. I analyzed more than 10,000 Chinese social media feeds and demonstrated the superiority of LSA with SPCA over traditional approaches using PyTorch.
